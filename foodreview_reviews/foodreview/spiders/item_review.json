But to my surprise I was seated in about 10-15 minutes. I think what took the longest about of time was really the food itself, which came out about 20 minutes after being seated. I was okay with this and knew to expect this because one of the servers informed me so. I got the beef noodle soup, spinach with garlic and the pork steamed dumplings. The dumplings are a must! They're perfectly chewy with a great depth of flavor with the soup/meat itself! The beef noodle soup just wasn't for me. I don't think it's horrible, but it just wasn't what I expected. and the spinach was amazing as well - it's definitely a must. It was pretty affordable, which I appreciated as well!The reason why I gave it only 4 stars is because the overall experience wasn't great and I have to say that I've had better quality plates at other places. But like a said, it's definitely worth a try!", "title": "Din Tai Fung"},

We visited a few Din Tai Fung restaurants when we were in Singapore and were blown away at their good quality control. At the same time we also thought that we were just lucky... ;-)Two things that we always ordered in Din Tai Fung were their shrimp &amp; pork shao mai and of course the 18 folds original Xiao Long Bao. DTF's xiao long bao is really in the league of their own. Honestly we never found any broken dumpling skin although I never really counted the number of folds on their dumpling.The shao mai was also always very delicious with plenty of pork meats inside. I always add vinegar to shao mai and the xiao long bao as I love the additional sour flavour on the meat. Of course the price of their dishes are more than the other Chinese restaurants but the quality never disappoints us.", "title": "Din Tai Fung"},

Having exposed ourselves exploring Singapore under extreme heat, we couldn't help but finding ourselves dining in a cool AC top-notch restaurant like Ding Tai Fung. This Taiwanese establishment is located right in the heart of Orchard area. Famously known for its Xiao Long Bao, Ding Tai Fung also features a bunch of other dimsum goodness, which we were determined to try them all out.We started with a refreshing dish of Oriental salad. The salad was crunchy and delicious, with standout ingredients like bean sprouts, Korean glass noodles and vinegar, which we believe is a perfect match to create the appetite since vinegar dressing salad is our favorite. Afterwards, here came our Steamed Pork Dumplings (Xiao Long Bao), Steamed Shrimp &amp; Pork Shaomai, Steamed Vegetable &amp; Pork Buns, and Steamed Finely Mashed Red Bean Dumplings. Of course, the spotlight should be given Xiao Long Bao. Sipping the water inside each bao is wonderful. The inside meat is well-flavored.Recommendation: Xiao Long Bao, Oriental SaladRead our full review at: thecoupleeats.com/singap\u2026", "title": "Din Tai Fung"},

I've had such high expectations for their soup dumplings that when they came out, I was a little disappointed. Not to say they weren't good or anything, because they were but just overly hyped.

I was at Orchard Road with my mother, and we had entered one of the shopping malls to purchase some stuff from Lush and by the time the shopping was done, it was closing on 9pm, and we both were just super hungry. I had noticed a food court level located in the same mall as the Lust store, so just took the elevetor up there and then looked at Yelp reviews and this one come up tops.Honestly, it wasn't a great first experience as when we approached the restaurant front of staff and asked about vegetarian options for my mother, the lady said there was nothing vegetarian available. But I asked to see menu and there _clearly_ were veg options that mum said she was interested in trying. So we got in and soon afterwards folks were turned away as the restaurant was closing at 10pm. We hurriedly ordered pretty much at random from the menu to be honest (and the list of foods ordered is in my photos), but gosh, all the food we got was so good and scrumptious, each bite was a delight and I walked away super happy to have had the opportunity/ chance to eat here (sometimes the food gods are truly with you!) My one regret however was that in rush of ordering, didn't get to try the XLB so am going to make it my mission once back in US next year, to get myself to a DTF and try this (#foodie 2016 new year resolution!)", "title": "Din Tai Fung"},

It was well worth the wait and when I found out that there are locations all over Singapore, I had to make a visit. This location is located on the top floor of the Wisma Atria which was super easy to get to from the Grand Hyatt where we were staying. I was delighted when we didn't have to wait at all and were seated immediately. They even set a carrier next to our table for all of our packages from shopping. I liked that a lot!I ordered the braised beef noodles and pork xlb which was what I had ordered in Seattle. Everything was delicious. I love that the xlb is consistent and still amazing no matter where you go to in the world. I did notice that the braised beef in my noodles was a lot more fatty that the meat pieces in Seattle. Perhaps it's the geographical preference.Another thing I noticed was my friend and I were practically the only Asian people in the restaurants making me think there are probably many xlb restaurants that give DTF a run for their money. But no matter, love the xlb here and had a great lunch.", "title": "Din Tai Fung"},

We arrived an hour before closing time. Before being able to order, we were told which dumplings they had run out of. My husband does not eat meat so it wasn't nice to hear that all of the fish dumplings and most of the vegetarian options were gone. But then again we were late.So we ordered a concoction of food that was mostly noodles and veggies, and 6 pieces of crab meat &amp; pork dumplings (for me). The order was placed shortly after 9 pm.Everyone around us seemed to be getting food (the place was relatively empty though) fast.Our first order arrived at around 9:35, everything else in about 5-minute-iterations, with a staff member asking us at 9:30 if we wanted to place a last order - which was a tad bizarre, with no other food having arrived yet. Also we had the dumpling-delivery-people stopping by our table often - only to carry on walking again after checking the contents - pretty funny, if you are NOT hungry that is. We finally had nearly all of our food (following a dumpling mix-up), when I was asked to pay and come to the till - where I had to wait for someone else to pay.Back to my- nearly cold - food, the last order arrived: the crab meat &amp; pork dumplings, with samples of black hair. I stopped a waiter who immediately offered a replacement. That took some time, which made the whole experience very late - with the supervisor apologising profusely, for both the wait and the hair situation.All in all, food was just ok. Pretty bland.Two stars for the wait staff, one for food. I guess we just hit a bad day but I won't be back, especially since my husband found that there is a huge difference in quality between here and Taipei. Taipei it shall be then, next time :-)", "title": "Din Tai Fung"},

The soup was okay, not as flavorful as I was hoping.....edible after adding some vinager &amp; spice.Our favorites were the chili crab buns and dumplings. The service was attentive and efficient. The only complaint was Jasmine tea was brought to the table without requesting it, so we thought it was complimentary. Upon checking the bill, we were charged $1.00/person......not a huge deal, but at least ask the customer if it is wanted.

In the US, two hour waits can be the norm, but there are just too many good food options here in Singapore.This Din Tai Fung was conveniently located in the Wisma Atria mall on there 4th floor (by the way, another incredible food court on this level as well), and was right across the street from our hotel. Wanting to see how it compares to the one in Bellevue, WA, we had an early lunch here. We ordered:Seaweed salad and tofu with honey sauce appetizers: both were good. I had the seaweed salad before, but the tofu dish was new to me: nice way to start the meal.Fried shrimp pancake: this was new to me as well, and was my favorite dish. Love how crispy and not greasy it was.Shrimp fried rice: standard but good.Shrimp and Chinese gourd dumplings: just ok: not that big of a fan of the gourd.Chili crab bun: this was really good, but you order them one each (should have gotten another one).Overall, very similar to the Din Tai Fung's in the US.
